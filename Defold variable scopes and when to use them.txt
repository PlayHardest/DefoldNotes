self - Shorthand that refers to the current script 
go - Shorthand that refers to the game object running the script
. - Shorthand resolving to the current game object.
# - Shorthand resolving to the current component.


For example:
 	msg.post(".", "acquire_input_focus") --gives input focus to the current game object

	msg.post("#", "reset") --resets the current script

	self.speed = 0 --sets the speed for the current script to 0

	go.get_position() --gets the position of the game object the script is connected to


Self vs local when defining properties : 
	Self is an instance variable and local will be shared with all using the same script. Only local variables declared outside the scope of the init(), final(), update(), etc. are available to all scripts of the same type.

The difference between a go.property() variable and a variable defined with self are
- A go.property() declared variable is accessible by other scripts using go.get() or go.set().
- A go.property() declared variable can be changed in the editor

When to define variables at varying scope levels:
 - go.property()
 	Used primarily when a varible on a script must vary between script instances (eg - changed from the properties window or when passed as an argument to factory.create()). Accessible via self.[variable_name] and go.get("[identifier]","[variable_name]")

 - self scope
 	Used primarily for any other instance-specific variable needed on a script that would not be necessarily needed to be altered. Accessible via self.[variable_name]

 - local scope
 	Used primarily for variables declared at the top level of a script for values that must shared between multiple instances of the same type of script. (E.g - a counter or a shared list of instances so that broadcasts can be made to all script instances of a certain type.). Accessible by any instance of the same script.

 - global scope
 	The variable is declared on the global table _G and is accessible from everywhere.
 	E.g (

 	//in original script
 	timeofday = "morning"

 	//in a different script
 	function init(self)
 		print(timeofday)
 		print(_G.timeofday)
 		print(_G["timeofday"])
 		//all three of these work


 	)
